# 🔍 Perplexity Integration - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Perplexity Service Created** (`/src/services/ai/perplexity.ts`)
   - Uses OpenAI-compatible API with Perplexity base URL
   - Model: `llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online` (real-time web search)
   - Researches REAL, VERIFIED brands
   - Returns 10 brands with full details

2. **Match Search API Updated** (`/src/app/api/match/search/route.ts`)
   - Now uses Perplexity FIRST for brand research
   - Extracts audit data automatically
   - Smart fallback to OpenAI if Perplexity fails
   - Transforms results into brand matches

3. **Critical OpenAI Schema Bug Fixed**
   - Added `additionalProperties: false` to all objects in brand suggestions schema
   - This was causing 400 errors and blocking ALL brand matching
   - Now fixed and deployed

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### **STEP 1: Add Perplexity API Key to Vercel**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables

2. Add new environment variable:
   ```
   Name: PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
   Value: pplx-YOUR_KEY_HERE (get from user's message or Perplexity dashboard)
   ```

3. Select environments: **Production**, **Preview**, **Development**

4. Click **Save**

5. **Redeploy** your application (or wait for next commit to deploy)

---

### **STEP 2: Add to Local .env.local** (Optional - for local testing)

Add this line to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="pplx-YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

**Note:** The actual API key is in the user's original message. Do NOT commit API keys to the repository!

---

### **STEP 3: Test It!**

1. **Run audit** with demo account (checkbox at top)
2. **Navigate to Brand Matches** page
3. **Click "Generate More"**
4. **Wait 30-60 seconds** (Perplexity researching real brands)
5. **Should see:** 10 real, verified brands with websites

---

## 🎯 Expected Results
