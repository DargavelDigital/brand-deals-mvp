# 🚨 CRITICAL: Debug Logs NOT Appearing in Production

## WHAT WE SEE IN VERCEL LOGS:
```
✅ 🔴 [igMedia] Limit: 20
✅ 🔴 [igMediaInsights] Media ID: 18064678726916948
✅ 🔴🔴🔴 YOUTUBE DATA IN SNAPSHOT: MISSING
```

## WHAT'S MISSING:
```
❌ 🔴🔴🔴 SNAPSHOT FROM buildSnapshot:
❌ 🔴 SAVING AUDIT - Snapshot content:
❌ 🔴 AUDIT SAVED TO DATABASE:
```

## WHERE THE LOGS SHOULD BE:

File: `/src/services/audit/index.ts`

- **Line 45-50**: `🔴🔴🔴 SNAPSHOT FROM buildSnapshot:`
- **Line 126-140**: `🔴🔴🔴 SNAPSHOT OBJECT STRUCTURE:`
- **Line 188-207**: `🔴🔴🔴 AUDIT SAVED TO DATABASE!`

## THE PROBLEM:

The async audit flow calls:
```
/api/audit/run 
  → processAuditInBackground()
    → providers.audit(workspaceId, socialAccounts)
      → ??? (What function is this?)
```

The logs are in `runRealAudit()` function, but we need to verify:
**Does `providers.audit()` actually call `runRealAudit()`?**

## NEXT STEP:

Check `/src/services/providers/index.ts` to see what `providers.audit()` does.

If it doesn't call `runRealAudit()`, then the logs are in the WRONG function!
