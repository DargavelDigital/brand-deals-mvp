# üéØ FOUND THE ISSUE! Two Different Audit Save Paths!

## THE MYSTERY SOLVED:

There are TWO places where audits are saved:

### Path 1: Main Audit Save (HAS MY LOGS)
**File**: `/src/services/audit/index.ts` (line 179)
```typescript
const audit = await prisma().audit.create({
  data: {
    snapshotJson: snapshotJsonToSave  // ‚Üê Complex object with socialSnapshot
  }
});
```
**Has**: All my debug logs ‚úÖ
**Problem**: This code path might NOT be executing!

### Path 2: Helper Audit Save (NO LOGS)
**File**: `/src/services/audit/helpers.ts` (line 14)
```typescript
const created = await prisma().audit.create({
  data: {
    workspaceId,
    sources: result.sources ?? [],
    snapshotJson: result.snapshot ?? result,  // ‚Üê Just passes through result!
  }
});
```
**Has**: NO debug logs ‚ùå
**Problem**: This might be the code path that's actually executing!

## THE SMOKING GUN:

The logs I see in Vercel:
```
üî¥ [igMedia] - From Instagram provider
üî¥ [igMediaInsights] - From Instagram provider
üî¥ Providers: Real audit returned: SUCCESS - From providers wrapper
```

But I DON'T see:
```
üî¥ SNAPSHOT FROM buildSnapshot - From audit/index.ts runRealAudit()
```

**This suggests** `runRealAudit()` is returning early or the result is being processed differently!

## HYPOTHESIS:

`runRealAudit()` returns an `AuditResult` object:
```typescript
return {
  auditId: audit.id,
  audience: auditData.audience,
  insights: [...],
  similarCreators: [...],
  sources: latestAudit.sources
};
```

But maybe there's ANOTHER wrapper that takes this result and saves it AGAIN using `helpers.ts`?

Or maybe the async background processing has a different code path?

## NEXT STEP:

Check if `processAuditInBackground()` calls runRealAudit() OR if it has its own audit creation logic!
