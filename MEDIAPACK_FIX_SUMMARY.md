# Media Pack Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The Media Pack generation was failing with a 403 error and "Generation failed" message because the `MEDIAPACK_V2` feature flag was disabled.

## Root Cause
The `MEDIAPACK_V2` environment variable was not set in `.env.local`, causing the feature flag to default to `false` in the `flags.ts` configuration.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Missing Environment Variables
Added the following to `.env.local`:
```bash
MEDIAPACK_V2="1"                    # Enable Media Pack v2 feature
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"     # Required for Media Pack generation
MEDIA_PACK_SIGNING_SECRET="dev-secret"  # Required for payload signing
```

### 2. Feature Flag Configuration
The `flags.mediapackV2` in `src/lib/flags.ts` now properly reads the `MEDIAPACK_V2` environment variable and enables the feature. The environment variable was added to the `env.ts` schema so it can be properly parsed.

### 3. API Route Behavior
- **Before**: API returned 403 "mediapack.v2 disabled" when feature flag was off
- **After**: API properly checks authentication and proceeds with Media Pack generation

## Files Modified
- `.env.local` - Added required environment variables
- `src/lib/env.ts` - Added MEDIAPACK_V2 to environment schema
- The feature flag system was already properly implemented, but needed the environment variable to be defined in the schema

## Testing
- Media Pack API now properly redirects to authentication instead of returning 403
- Feature flag is enabled and Media Pack generation should work for authenticated users

## Next Steps
1. Test Media Pack generation in the UI
2. Ensure all required dependencies (Playwright, Chromium) are available
3. Verify PDF generation works correctly
