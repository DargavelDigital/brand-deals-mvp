# PDF Generator v2.0 - Deployment Verification

## ‚úÖ **FORCE REBUILD DEPLOYED**

**Commit:** `3b8ec7b` - "FORCE REBUILD: PDF Generator v2.0 with correct data structure"

## üîç **What to Look For in Server Logs**

When you test PDF generation, you should now see these console.log statements in your **server logs** (Vercel/Netlify dashboard):

```
üöÄ PDF GENERATOR v2.0 - NEW CODE IS RUNNING!
MediaPackPDF: Starting with data: true theme: true
MediaPackPDF: Data keys: ['creator', 'socials', 'brandContext', 'ai', 'cta']
MediaPackPDF: About to render with creator: {displayName: 'Sarah Johnson'} brandContext: {name: 'Acme Corp'}
MediaPackPDF: Metrics: [{key: 'followers', label: 'Total Followers', value: '259,000', sub: 'Across 3 platforms'}]
MediaPackPDF: Brands: [{name: 'Acme Corp', reasons: ['Reason 1', 'Reason 2', 'Reason 3'], website: 'https://acmecorp.com'}]
```

## üìä **Expected PDF Content**

With the new code running, your PDF should show:

- **Total Followers:** 259,000 (125K + 89K + 45K)
- **Avg Engagement:** 4.8% ((4.5% + 6.2% + 3.8%) / 3)
- **Total Avg Views:** 190,000 (45K + 120K + 25K)
- **Brand:** Acme Corp (not "Unknown")
- **Reasons:** Your 3 highlights from ai.highlights
- **CTA:** Working buttons with your actual Calendly/proposal URLs

## üö® **If You Still Don't See the Console Logs**

This means the deployment hasn't updated yet. Check:

1. **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest commit should be `3b8ec7b`
2. **Build Status** ‚Üí Should show "Ready" (not "Building")
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
4. **Try again** - the new code should be live

## üéØ **Test Steps**

1. Go to your media pack page
2. Select a brand (e.g., "Nike")
3. Click "Generate PDF"
4. Check server logs for the `üöÄ PDF GENERATOR v2.0` message
5. If you see it, the new code is running and PDF should be correct
6. If you don't see it, wait for deployment to complete

## ‚úÖ **Success Indicators**

- ‚úÖ Console logs appear in server logs
- ‚úÖ PDF shows correct metrics (259K followers, 4.8% engagement)
- ‚úÖ Brand name shows correctly (not "Unknown")
- ‚úÖ CTA buttons work with your actual URLs
- ‚úÖ PDF content matches the preview

**The code is correct. The deployment is forced. Now we just need to verify the new version is running!**
