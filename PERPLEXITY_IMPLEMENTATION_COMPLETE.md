- 🤝 **Works with Influencers** badge (purple) if applicable
- 📊 **Match Score** percentage
- 📝 **Why They're a Good Fit** reasoning
- ✅ **Approve/Reject** actions

---

## 🔧 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

### **ONLY 1 THING LEFT:**

Add the `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` to Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables
2. Add:
   ```
   Name: PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
   Value: pplx-YOUR_KEY_HERE (use the key from the original request)
   ```
3. Select: Production, Preview, Development
4. Save and redeploy

---

## 🧪 TEST IT:

1. ✅ Run audit with demo account
2. ✅ Go to Brand Matches page
3. ✅ Click "Generate More"
4. ✅ Wait 30-60 seconds (watch the loading message)
5. ✅ Should see 10 REAL brands with:
   - Verified badges
   - Real company websites
   - Company size info
   - Influencer marketing indicators

---

## 💻 FILES CHANGED:

### **Backend:**
- ✅ `/src/services/ai/perplexity.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `/src/ai/promptPacks/brand.suggestions.v1.ts` (Fixed schema)
- ✅ `/src/app/api/match/search/route.ts` (Integrated Perplexity)

### **Frontend:**
- ✅ `/src/app/[locale]/tools/matches/page.tsx` (Loading state)
- ✅ `/src/components/matches/BrandCard.tsx` (Verified badges & details)

### **Documentation:**
- ✅ `PERPLEXITY_SETUP.md` (Setup guide)
- ✅ `PERPLEXITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (This file)

---

## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS:

1. User clicks "Generate More"
2. Frontend shows loading: "🔍 Researching real brands..."
3. Backend extracts audit data (followers, niche, themes, engagement)
4. Calls Perplexity AI with real-time web search
5. Perplexity researches 10 REAL companies
6. Returns verified brands with websites, company info
7. Backend transforms into brand matches
8. Frontend displays with verified badges & details

---

## 🎯 BENEFITS:

### **Before:**
- ❌ OpenAI making up fake brands ("Fashion Co.")
- ❌ No real websites or information
- ❌ Generic loading message
- ❌ No verification indicators

### **After:**
- ✅ Perplexity researching REAL companies
- ✅ Verified websites and information
- ✅ Professional loading experience
- ✅ Clear verified badges
- ✅ Company size and influencer marketing indicators
- ✅ Smart fallback to OpenAI if Perplexity fails

---

## 💰 COST:

- **Per research:** ~$0.20-0.40 (10 brands)
- **Worth it:** Real, verified brands vs made-up ones
- **Optimization:** Can cache results per audit

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### "Perplexity research failed"
- Check API key is set in Vercel
- Check Vercel logs for error details
- Should automatically fall back to OpenAI

### "No brands found"
- Audit needs to be complete
- Run audit with demo account to test
- Check audit snapshot has required data

### "Brands don't show verified badge"
- Check brand source is 'perplexity' or 'seed'
- Verify convertToUIBrand() is passing verified field
- Check Vercel logs for Perplexity success

---

## ✅ SUMMARY:

**ALL 6 STEPS COMPLETE!** 🎉

The Perplexity integration is fully implemented in both backend and frontend. 

Just add the API key to Vercel and test it! 🚀

---

**Next:** Add `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` to Vercel and redeploy!
