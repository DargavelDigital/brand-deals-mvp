# 🚨 HYPOTHESIS: Error Happening Between buildSnapshot and Save

## EVIDENCE:

**Logs that DO appear:**
```
✅ 🔴 [igMedia] - Instagram fetch (early in process)
✅ 🔴 [igMediaInsights] - Instagram API calls (early)
✅ 🔴🔴🔴 YOUTUBE DATA - In buildSnapshot (early-mid)
```

**Logs that DON'T appear:**
```
❌ 🔴🔴🔴 SNAPSHOT FROM buildSnapshot - After buildSnapshot (mid)
❌ 🔴 SAVING AUDIT - Before save (late)
❌ 🔴 AUDIT SAVED - After save (late)
```

## CONCLUSION:

**An error is happening AFTER buildSnapshot() completes but BEFORE the save logs!**

## EXECUTION FLOW:

```
1. buildSnapshot() starts ✅ (logs appear)
2. Instagram API calls ✅ (logs appear)
3. buildSnapshot() completes ❓
4. Log "SNAPSHOT FROM buildSnapshot" ❌ (doesn't appear!)
5. AI processing happens ❓
6. Create snapshotJson ❓
7. Log "SAVING AUDIT" ❌ (doesn't appear!)
8. prisma.audit.create() ❓
```

**Error likely happens at step 3-4!**

## POSSIBLE ERRORS:

1. **buildSnapshot() throws an error** - caught by try-catch, logs never reached
2. **Type error accessing snapshot.instagram** - code crashes silently
3. **AI processing (lines 78-122) throws error** - code never reaches save
4. **detectCreatorStage() throws error** (line 61-72)

## THE SMOKING GUN:

The user's database shows the audit WAS created (with empty socialSnapshot), which means:
- ✅ buildSnapshot() completed
- ✅ AI processing completed
- ✅ prisma.audit.create() ran
- ❌ But my logs between lines 45-207 NEVER executed!

**This means there are TWO CODE PATHS and my logs are in the wrong one!**

## NEXT CHECK:

Look for ANOTHER audit save function or a try-catch that has a fallback save!
