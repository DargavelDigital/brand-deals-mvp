## üöÄ Deployment

### Netlify Deployment

This project is configured for static export and Netlify deployment:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Push to `feature/workflow-skeleton-setup` branch triggers automatic Netlify deployment
2. **Build Command**: `pnpm install && pnpm build:static`
3. **Publish Directory**: `out/`
4. **Environment**: Node.js 20, pnpm 8

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build for production
pnpm build:static

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```

## üìã Release Runbook

### Automated Release Process

Use the release runner script for automated deployments:

```bash
# Full release process (recommended)
node scripts/release/release.mjs STAGING
node scripts/release/release.mjs PRODUCTION

# With options
node scripts/release/release.mjs PRODUCTION --mock
node scripts/release/release.mjs STAGING --non-interactive
```

### Manual Release Steps

#### 1. Environment Validation
```bash
# Validate staging environment
node scripts/release/01_check-env.mjs STAGING

# Validate production environment  
node scripts/release/01_check-env.mjs PRODUCTION
```

#### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Run migrations for staging
node scripts/release/02_db-migrate.mjs

# Run migrations for production
node scripts/release/02_db-migrate.mjs
```

#### 3. Smoke Tests
```bash
# Test staging endpoints
node scripts/release/03_smoke.mjs STAGING

# Test production endpoints
node scripts/release/03_smoke.mjs PRODUCTION
```

#### 4. Cache Warming
```bash
# Warm staging cache
node scripts/release/04_cache-warm.mjs STAGING

# Warm production cache (with mock data if needed)
node scripts/release/04_cache-warm.mjs PRODUCTION --mock
```

### Staging Deployment Checklist

```bash
# 1. Validate environment
node scripts/release/01_check-env.mjs STAGING

# 2. Deploy database changes
node scripts/release/02_db-migrate.mjs

# 3. Verify endpoints work
node scripts/release/03_smoke.mjs STAGING

# 4. Prime cache for performance
node scripts/release/04_cache-warm.mjs STAGING

# 5. Manual verification
curl https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/health
curl https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/contacts
```

### Production Deployment Checklist

```bash
# 1. Validate production environment
node scripts/release/01_check-env.mjs PRODUCTION

# 2. Deploy database changes
node scripts/release/02_db-migrate.mjs

# 3. Verify production endpoints
node scripts/release/03_smoke.mjs PRODUCTION

# 4. Warm production cache
node scripts/release/04_cache-warm.mjs PRODUCTION

# 5. Post-deployment verification
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/billing/summary
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

- **Environment validation fails**: Check `.env.local` and required variables
- **Database migration fails**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` and database connectivity
- **Smoke tests fail**: Ensure application is running and accessible
- **Cache warming fails**: Check if endpoints require authentication

#### Rollback Commands

```bash
# Revert to previous database migration
npx prisma migrate reset

# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# View migration history
npx prisma migrate status --schema=prisma/schema.prisma
```
