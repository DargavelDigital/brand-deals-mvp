## 💡 **KEY DESIGN DECISIONS**

### **Why Sequence is Default**
Research shows automated follow-ups increase response rates by 30-50%. Sequence mode is pre-selected to nudge users toward best practices.

### **Why Timeline Visualization**
Users need to understand *when* emails send. The visual timeline with day markers makes the sequence concrete and builds confidence.

### **Why Multi-Email Preview**
Users should see all emails before committing. The tabbed navigation lets them review the entire sequence flow.

### **Why Match Quality Indicators**
The "95% match" badge builds trust in the AI matching system and reassures users about email relevance.
